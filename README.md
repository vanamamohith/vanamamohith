#### I am very passionate about Technology, So after my undergraduation I worked as a Developer. I want to gain more knowledge in Technology, So I took Computer Science in Master's at Northwest Missouri State University and want to be as a Full Stack Developer.

#### Coming to my Acitivities, I love playing Badminton and sometimes I do Art. I have few collections of my pencil art, Clay art and Crayon art.
